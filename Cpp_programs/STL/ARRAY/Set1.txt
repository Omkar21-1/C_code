Of course! Here are some practice questions involving the Array class of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL):

 1.   Write a program to initialize an array of integers using the Array class and display its contents.
 
 2.   Implement a function that takes two arrays as input and returns true if they have the same elements in the same order, otherwise return false.
 
 3.   Create a program that finds the maximum element in an array of integers using the Array class.
 
 4.   Write a function to reverse the elements of an array using the Array class.
 
 5.   Implement a program to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array using the Array class.
 
 6.   Write a function that takes an array of integers and removes all occurrences of a specified value, using the Array class.
 
 7.   Develop a program that checks if an array is sorted in non-decreasing order using the Array class.
 
 8.   Implement a function to calculate the sum of all elements in an array using the Array class.
 
 9.   Write a program that takes an array of integers and rotates it left by a specified number of positions using the Array class.
 
 10.  Create a program to sort an array of integers in ascending order using the Array class and any sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort).

These questions should help you practice various operations and algorithms using the Array class in C++. Good luck with your practice! Let me know if you need further assistance with any of these questions.
